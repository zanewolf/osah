                    We will offer a workshop at the beginning of each semester, starting in Spring 2023, to help undergraduates understand ocean scholarship across the University. In this workshop, we will address common questions and concerns regarding research, and outline several ways to find and join groups or labs that pique your interest.

                        <p>Conducting research as an undergraduate alongside coursework can be an important piece of building a career in marine science. Research can be conducted for credit, for pay, and as work towards a thesis, all during the semester as your schedule allows. Research opportunities for undergraduates are commonly found by reaching out to faculty. In addition, the following within-Harvard databases may including postings/opportunities in marine science. Note that we are encouraging PIs to post opportunities to broaden access to marine science at Harvard.</p>

                            Gaining experience outside of Harvard labs can also be valuable in building your expertise in marine science. Such opportunities may occur through study abroad, during the summer break or J term, or even just after graduation. The databases below are a few that include a wide range of research opportunities, internships, and jobs outside of Harvard for during and after graduation.
